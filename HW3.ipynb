    "We will prove this statement by contradiction. Suppose, there exists a circle where every three consecutive integers had a sum less than 17 (less than or equal to 16). In this circle, each integer is part of three different sums. It is part of the sum with the two integers before it. It is part of the sum with the two integers behind it. It is also a part of the sum with the two integers around. \n",

    "Since no integer can be repeated: $w \\neq x \\neq y \\neq z$. It also follows that $w, x, y, z \\leq 5$, since if $w, x, y, z$ were $6$, one could not add another number from the circle and have a sum less than or equal to $16$. It also follows that the sum $w + x$, $x + y$ and $y + z$ all have to be less than or equal to $6$. Because of the aforementioned fact, the sum of all four integers will also have to be less than or equal to $12$. Since, the sum of all four integers will have to be less than or equal to $12$, either $3, 4$ or $5$ will need to be excluded from $w, x, y, z$ ($3 + 4 + 5 = 12$, so adding one more would be greater than $12$). Since we need to select four numbers $w, x, y, z$, from the set ${1, 2, 3, 4, 5}$ and we cannot select $3, 4$ and $5$ (only two out of the three), two out of the four variables need to be $1$ and $2$ respectively. The other two variables will either be $3, 4$ or $5$.\n",

If we focus on the sum that does not overlap with $10$'s pairs on either side we have: \n",

    "$a + b$ must be less than or equal to $7$. Since $1$ and $2$ are already used by the ten's pair we can choose from the set ${3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8}$. Since two of ${3, 4, 5}$ will already be selected, there is no possible way to select two numbers that sum less than or equal to $7$. The only possible way to get less than or equal to $7$, is if we selected $3$ and $4$, however either $3$ or $4$ will already be selected, so we have a contradiction.    \n",

    "Proof: We will prove the aforementioned statement by contradiction. Suppose that the product of a nonzero rational number and an irrational number is rational. Let $a/b$ be a rational number where $a$ and $b$ are both nonzero integers. Let $x$ be an irrational number. Since the product of $a/b$ and $x$ is rational there exists integers $c$ and $d$ such that the following equation is satisfied: $a/b * x = c/d$. Since $a$ is a nonzero integer, we can multiply both sides of the equation by the reciprocal $b/a$, yielding: $x = \\frac{cb}{da}$. Since $a,b,c,d$ are all integers, $cb$ and $da$ will both be integers under closure of integers under multiplication. Also, since $d$ and $a$ are both nonzero integers, it follows that $da$ is nonzero. Hence, $\\frac{cb}{da}$ is rational by definition. However, it is equal to $x$ and $x$ is supposed to be an irrational number, so we have a contradiction. Therefore, we have proven that the product of a nonzero rational number and an irrational number is irrational.        \n",

Let x be a irrational number, and let y be an  nonzero integer. Suppose, $xy$ is rational, i.e. $x * y = a/b$, where $a$ is some integer and $b$ is some nonzero integer. Dividing both sides by y (y is nonzero by definition) yields: $x = \\frac{a}{by}$. Since $b$ and $y$ are both integers the product $by$ is also an integer under closure of integers under multiplication. Therefore, $\\frac{a}{by}$ is a rational number since $a$ and $by$ are both integers. However, this is equal to $x$ which is irrational, so we have a contradiction. Therefore, a nonzero integer multiplied with an irrational number is irrational."
