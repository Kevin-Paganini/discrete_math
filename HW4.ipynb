    "A simple algorithm could solve this problem. First I would initialize a variable named min_val and store the zeroth element of the list. I would initialize another variable named min_index and store $0$ there, i.e. the index of min_val. Then I would loop through the list from the first (second in non-cs terms) element to the $n_{th}$ element. Each time looping through I would check to see if the element at the index is smaller or equal to the min_val. If it is, then I will save the element at the current index to min_val and save the current index to min_index. At the end of the loop I will then return min_index.

However, through trials one can see that if there were a 12 cent coin and the cashiers algorithm would be used it would on average use less coins than a standard coin system. A hypotheses this leads me to is that each coin that you add decreases the average amount of coins needed to be given out using the cashiers algorithm."
